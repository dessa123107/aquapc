                        <br><p>We are two kids who love technology. Personally I have been messing with it for as long as I can remember. <br>
                            We love to build Computers, and the quality that they bring is amazing. <br>
                            We love having a creation of our own, knowing that it will end up satisfying someone else!<br> </p>
                            <br> <h1>Our Backrounds</h1>

                           <p>
                               I have been gaming for years. I started on a PS3 and I loved to play with my cousins, and brother. It was not until a couple months back that i aspired PC gaming. But once I had my own, I had fallen in love with it. The idea of building something on my own, and then using it everyday was amazing. Thats where this company idea started.

                           <p>Hi, I am the Co owner, and main developer of this company. My backstory starts from me being younger. I took apart calculators, old phones, whatever I could. It was about the age of 10 when I took apart my first phone, fixed the screen, and replaced it. It had worked. I loved building things. Then recently I am intersted in coding, as you can see by this website. I will be the one handling the startup and overall setup for the computers.</p>
